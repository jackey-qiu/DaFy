### To process measurements from BM25 this configuration is needed
# typically one would execute: 
# python2 binoculars/binoculars.py process config_bm25

### the DISPATCHER is responsible for job management
[dispatcher]
type = local # SingleCore # local # SingleCore can be aborted by Ctrl+c
# ncores = 4 # optionally, specify number of cores (autodetect by default)

# specify destination file using scan numbers
destination=/data/visitor/XYZ/spaces/sample_{first}.hdf5
overwrite = true

### choose an appropriate INPUT class and specify custom options
[input]
type = bm25:eh2scd # refers to class EH2SCD in BINoculars/backends/bm25.py
imagefile = /data/visitor/XYZ/bm25/sample_{scannr:03d}_*.edf

## approximate number of images per job
target_weight = 50 

# technical details for this particular input class
centralpixel = 1892.0,1357.5
xmask = 1600-2200  # full size = 0-3824          	        
ymask = 700-1300  # full size = 0-1911
sddy_offset= -1288.5  # sample detector distance Y offset
sddx_offset= 0 # detector X offset
sddz_offset= 0 # detector Z offset
ccdth_offset= -0.05
pixelsize=0.06552, 0.06552  # in mm

### choose PROJECTION plus resolution
[projection]
type = bm25:qprojection # refers to QProjection in BINoculars/backends/bm25.py

resolution = 0.004,0.001,0.002 # or just give one number for all
